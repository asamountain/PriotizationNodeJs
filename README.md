<think>The user wants me to create a simple, beginner-friendly README file for their priority task app. This should be extremely accessible even for someone who has never coded before. I'll create a README that:

1. Explains what the app does in simple terms
2. Provides clear, step-by-step instructions on how to start and use the app
3. Includes visual cues like emojis to make it more approachable
4. Avoids technical jargon where possible, and explains it when necessary
5. Provides troubleshooting help for common issues (like the multiple browser windows issue)

I'll make it friendly and reassuring for complete beginners.</think># Priority Task Manager üìã
