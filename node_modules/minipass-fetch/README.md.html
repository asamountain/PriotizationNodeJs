<p>An implementation of window.fetch in Node.js using Minipass streams</p>
<p>This is a fork (or more precisely, a reimplementation) of
<a href="http://npm.im/node-fetch">node-fetch</a>.  All streams have been replaced
with <a href="http://npm.im/minipass">minipass streams</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this module is to stay in sync with the API presented by
<code>node-fetch</code>, with the exception of the streaming interface provided.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Minipass streams are faster and more deterministic in their timing contract
than node-core streams, making them a better fit for many server-side use
cases.</p>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>See <a href="http://npm.im/node-fetch">node-fetch</a></p>
<p>Differences from <code>node-fetch</code> (and, by extension, from the WhatWG Fetch
specification):</p>
<ul>
<li>Returns <a href="http://npm.im/minipass">minipass</a> streams instead of node-core
streams.</li>
<li>Supports the full set of <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_https_request_options_callback">TLS Options that may be provided to
<code>https.request()</code></a>
when making <code>https</code> requests.</li>
</ul>
